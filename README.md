# OptimusFTC32548

A responsive black-and-white website for Optimus FTC 32548, one of Round Rock High School’s robotics teams in Round Rock, Texas. No build step or package installation is required.

## GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is configured to serve the `main` branch from the repository root.

The current GitHub Pages address is shown in the repository’s Pages settings.

## Netlify hosting

The `netlify.toml` file configures this static website for deployment without a build command.

In Netlify, import this GitHub repository as an existing project and deploy the `main` branch. Leave the build command empty and use `.` as the publish directory. Set the project name to `OptimusFTC32548` if that name is available. Netlify provides a public address that does not contain the GitHub account username.

## Open the website

Unzip the download and open `index.html` in your browser. Keep `styles.css` and `script.js` beside it.

## Run locally

To serve the website locally, run this from the website folder:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 3000 --bind 0.0.0.0
```

## Customize

- Edit `index.html` for team information, robot updates, and contact details.
- Edit `styles.css` for colors and layout.
- The hero robot is an original SVG concept illustration, not a photograph of the team's robot.
- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/optimus_ftc/ (linked in the contact section and footer).
- Build updates and additional contact details can be added when available.
- Google Fonts are optional; system fallback fonts work offline.

The files can be hosted on any static website host. No backend, credentials, or database is required.
